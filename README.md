# PathAlgoVisualizer
Visualizing Shortest path algorithms to solve a maze using the Java Swing library.

Currently just uses a "dumb" flood fill algorithm that checks every undiscovered cell. Improvements to include "smarter" algorithms like Breadth First Search and Depth First Search in the process.
